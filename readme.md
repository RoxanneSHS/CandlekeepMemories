style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The CtB mod originally created by Charles Bisson is a large and vast collection of different quests that are unrelated to each other. Apart from this, it also added a lot of outdated stuff like all the old big mods from the pre-weidu era did. The BG2EE/EET version had become really buggy, far too large and littered with outdated ideas, items and spells.<br>

The attempt of this series of mods is to make individual quests out of the package available in a modernized way, easy to install, selectable and maintainable for bug fixing.

Some modules require the worldmap mod because they add areas outside the standard map's boundaries.<br>
