@1   = ~Good day friend!  You are the child of Gorion, are you not?  I recognize you from his letters, for he writes of you often.  Forgive my manners; I am Jaheira and this is Khalid, my husband.~
@2   = ~We are old friends of your adopted father.  He is not with you?  I must assume the worst; he would not permit his only child to wander without his accompaniment.~
@3   = ~If......if he has passed, we share your loss.~
@4   = ~Gorion often said that he worried for your safety, even at the expense of his own.  He also wished that Khalid and I would become your guardians, if he should ever meet an untimely end.  However, you are much older now, and the choice of your companions should be your own.~
@5   = ~It would be a fitting last service to Gorion, though we should first go to Nashkel.  Khalid and I.....look into local concerns, and there are rumors of strange things happening at the mine.  No doubt you have heard of the iron shortage?  You would do well to help us.  It affects everyone, including you.  We are to meet the mayor of the town, Berrun Ghastkill.~
@6   = ~G-good to know you..~
@7   = ~We could t-travel with you until you get settled; help you find your l-lot in life.~
